  # Vulpkanin

  Vulpkanin are canine-like humanoids, sporting distinct ears and tails. They see the world in reds and greens,
  deal [color=#ec3a3a]blunt [/color]and [color=#ec3a3a]slash [/color] damage with their claws, and their fur
  insulates them from environment temperature at the cost of making them 15% more vulnerable to Heat damage.

  ## Lore

  Not much is known about the world which the Vulpakanin originated from besides it's now ancient destruction. What is known is that their species would eventually find their way to the moon of the planet Terra, origin world
  of the Human species. There they would form a colony which to this day still persists. Many Vulpakanin would then form a strange fascination with moons and adopt some traits similar to that of the were-wolves of Terra.
  The misconception of were-wolves being Vulpkanins and vice versa has long since been debunked, however.
