  Rodentia are a species of bipedal beings resembling rodents. Resourceful, evasive, sneaky, but fragile.

  ## Diet

  - Can eat raw meat.
  - Will get poisoned by Theobromine (Chocolate, Tea, Coffee) and Allicin (Onion, Garlic).

  ## Benefits

  - Uses their claws to do some Slashing and Blunt damage.
  - Can fit in duffelbags.

  ## Special

  - Can Rummage in disposal chutes, which can sometimes dig up food.
  - Can store small items in their cheeks. Having items in their mouth makes their speech unintelligible, and they will drop all items in their mouth if attacked, stunned, or shoved.
  - Can "sneak" underneath tables, but not doors.
  - Smaller than most other species.

  ## Drawbacks

  - Takes 15% more Blunt, Slash, and Piercing damage.
  - Always triggers mousetraps, regardless of whether or not they are wearing shoes.
  - Gets hungry 33% faster.

  ## Lore

  Rodentia, rather than simply being a singular species, is the general term for a multitude of rodent resembling species throughout the galaxy. Interestingly, most of the Rodentia collective originated from the same world
  bringing into question whether or not Rodentia are an example of natural evolution or genetic creation. Rodentia culture is highly diverse, but many have the common through line of not caring whether their origins are
  evolution or being made and instead focus on the importance of being here.
