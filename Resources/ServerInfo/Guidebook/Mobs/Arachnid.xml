  They have two additional Pocket slots in their inventory. They can eat raw meat without any ill effects, but some foods like chocolate and onion poisons them.
  They suffocate 50% faster, and their Blue Blood can't be metabolised from Iron, being based on Copper instead.

  Their unarmed attacks deal Piercing damage instead of Blunt.

  Arachnids can create Websilk at the cost of getting more hungry. They (and only they) can craft bundles of websilk into various items from clothing and shields to entire walls.


  ## Lore

  Due to a tragedy which brought their origin world to the forgotten portion of history, many Arachnids have been placed in the circumstance of nomads. 
  Their retaining of sericulture has allowed them much more ease in terms of survival, but other means were required in giving themselves a sense of identity. 
  Many Arachnids find themselves placing a high value on interests of theirs as a result. To insult most Arachnids favorite food, for example, is a blow taken quite seriously.
