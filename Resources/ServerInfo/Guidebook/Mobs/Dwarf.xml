  # Dwarves

  Dwarves are similar to humans in most respects, however,
  They are not poisoned by alcohol and instead are even slightly healed by it.
  Their mining instincts allow them to feel nearby ore in 3 tile radius.
  They are slightly smaller than humans, though are also slightly heavier.
  They suffocate two times faster.

  ## Lore

  Dwarves are a considered to be either the second or third genetically created offshoot of the Human species, with their genetic deviations appearing to not originate from another species. 
  Their creation date is unknown, but it is suspected that they were created as to be miners on far off salvaging operations. Either this or those who became the first Dwarves were very interested in fantasy media.
  Culturally, they tend to enjoy booze and mining just as much as this media details.
